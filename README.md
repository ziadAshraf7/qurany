# Holy Quran Web Application

This web application provides an interactive experience for reading, listening, and understanding the Holy Quran. Built with **React**, **Material-UI**, and **React Query**, the site offers two main sections for navigating the Quran: by Juz and by Surah. Users can listen to the Quran recited by different readers, explore the meaning of verses through multiple Tafsir sources, and switch between different languages.

## Features

### 1. Sections for Juz and Surah
- Users can explore the Quran by **Juz** (sections) or **Surah** (chapters).
- Each section provides a list of **audio readers**, allowing users to choose their preferred reciter.

### 2. Listening to Surah or Juz
- The listening page for a specific Surah or Juz includes:
  - **Ayat** (verses) displayed clearly.
  - **Language input** options to change the display language of the Quranic text.
  - **Ayah number selection**, allowing users to jump to any specific verse.

### 3. Tafsir Section
- Each Ayah has an option to view **Tafsir** (interpretation), with various types of Tafsir available for in-depth study.
